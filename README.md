Kickstarting with Excel
This Kickstarter project shows a detailed analysis and visualization of fundraising goals and outcomes towards Louise’s play “Fever”.  This document represents a summary further backed by excel data sheets attached in this github repository.


Overview of Project
The project involved analyzing data obtained from fundraising campaigns from 2009 till 2017 in various countries including the United States and Great Britain. Fundraising campaigns encompassed all categories of arts and culture including Film, media, theatre, music, play, food, games, journalism, technology, photography and publishing. 

Purpose
The aim of this data analysis and visualisation was to infer from results obtained, to determine outcomes based on Launch date and goals (financial) in order to inform and make decisions in future fundraising campaigns.

Analysis and Challenges 

Parent Category  Outcomes:
The Kickstarter data was a rich data which had to be converted from timestamp into date format. It also had 9 parent Categories and 36 Subcategories, representing various campaigns run over the years. Music and Theater campaigns happened to yield the most successful outcomes. Although the Theather campaign yeilded the highest it also recorded the highest failed outcomes as compared to music which had fewer failed outcomes. The technology campaign however had the largest number of cancellations. 
Food, games, photography and publishing campaigns yielded comparatively very low outcomes.

Subcategory Outcomes:
The plays subcategory campaign yielded the highest number of successful outcomes which far outweighed all the other subcategories. Similarly, it also yielded the highest number of failed campaign outcomes. All other subcategories yielded much lower successful outcomes from their campaigns.

Conclusions

The Theatre campaign overall, as compared to the other campaigns yielded the most successful outcome, with the highest resulting from the campaign launched in May (111). The Music campaign followed as the second category to have a successful outcome in general, also recording their highest successful outcomes (54) in the May and January. The Film and Video campaign came in as the third, achieving their highest successful campaign outcome (37) in the March. Overall, it seems May happens to be a good month to launch campaigns.

The Journalism team was the only team with no successful outcomes but cancellations with July recording the highest cancellations (7) for the team. The Food campaign seemed to have more failed campaign launches than successful launches in general.


It could also be concluded that most of the target financial goals were successfully achieved for amounts pledged under $1000. The higher the amount, the lower the chances of successfully reaching the targeted financial goal for the fundraising campaign.
 
Limitations
A few limitations encountered during this project might have been the enormity or volume of the data presented/collected. This data presents, data collected over 7 years which is a long duration over which data collection was performed this could create room for numerous confounding factors to come into play over the period.


Recommendation 
Some other possible tables and graphs that could be created would be Pie- charts and Box and whisker charts.
